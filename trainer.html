My professional journey started at K9 Ponderosa, owned by Scott McConachie as a kennel tech in Delaware, Ohio, eventually working my way up to be the head trainer. I’ve expanded my passion for learning dogs attending the following workshops and shadow programs.</p>

                                        <p>&ldquo;Thanks to Joey our reactive dog Bear, went from getting kicked out of a group training class/being told he needed to be “medicated” to sitting and walking next to other dogs with no reaction during his FIRST session. Joey helped us achieve what we thought was impossible because we had honestly started to wonder if we would ever be able to have our dog around other dogs again. 
                                            Joey is extremely qualified and he is great at sharing his knowledge with you in a way that’s easy to understand. He has helped us learn so much about both of our dogs Bear and Kai, after only two sessions we have already started to see some major changes. I would literally recommend Joey to anyone, regardless of the specific circumstance, because he is up for the challenge and he genuinely cares about helping his clients as much as he possibly can. Whether it’s boarding, daycare, or training this is the place to go!!!”&rdquo;</p>

                                            Joey has to be the most caring and hardworking trainer I’ve ever met! He puts 110% into working with the dogs and their owners. I met Joey after looking up trainers/doggie daycares online. My dog Mav had been written up time and time again at his last daycare. Needless to say, I was at my wits end on what to do and where to turn. I’m so beyond happy to call Hoosier Canine’s family to Mav and me. So if your looking for a trainer or daycare for your dog …your search is over cause you’ve found the BEST!! &rdquo;</p>

I’ve been back and forth to Bloomington between moves, and he is always our go-to for boarding and training when I am in town. Leo can be very insecure around new people and unfamiliar surroundings so finding somewhere to board him while I’m away can be a bit of a struggle. Hoosier Canine is the ONLY place I will leave him and can feel confident that he is in the best hands. When Leo is in one of his “weird” timid moods while boarding, Joey will spend one on one time with him working on commands, etc. to get him back to feeling secure and happy.  You definitely won’t find that level of care and attention anywhere else! Even after living in a big city and trying out several different places for boarding and training, I can confidently say Hoosier Canine is the only place I truly trust with Leo!&rdquo;</p>

He is caring and loving with dogs but also knows how to establish assertion and get them to listen. We did a multiple-week training program with him and both our dogs and us made huge, instant improvements we didn’t think were possible. He was very clear in explaining things and getting us to do the exercises right. He’s fun to be with during training sessions and it’s amazing how quickly and easily dogs take to him. Plus, his Instagram Stories are the best — we could watch him train dogs and see them play in his backyard all day long. — Armin &amp; Bryony + Frida (black lab) &amp; Mamut (pittie), Bloomington, IN&rdquo;</p>

                                        <p>&ldquo;Joey has to be the most caring and hardworking trainer I’ve ever met! He puts 110% into working with the dogs and their owners. I met Joey after looking up trainers/doggie daycares online. My dog Mav had been written up time and time again at his last daycare. Needless to say, I was at my wits end on what to do and where to turn. I’m so beyond happy to call Hoosier Canine’s family to Mav and me. So if your looking for a trainer or daycare for your dog …your search is over cause you’ve found the BEST!!&rdquo;</p>

                               At Hoosier Canine we specialize in helping you on your journey to create the family dog you've always wanted! I have multiple programs that address behavioral issues, on leash walking, off leash freedom as well as puppy programs.  I start with a free evaluation in order to get to know you and your dog(s) a bit better. We then will pick the program that fits best for the both of you and then set a start date. Start this process by booking your free evaluation today!</p>
